# Fetch_Recipes

### Steps to Run the App

1. Clone the project.
2. Build the project using Xcode 15.3 (it's likely that it builds on other Xcode versions too, but I haven't checked them).
3. Run the build on any simulator/device with iOS 14 and higher.

### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?

- **Functional requirements.** The application's purpose should be clear to the user, which is why itâ€™s important to include features that make it useful.
- **Clean and intuitive UX/UI.** The interface is the first part of the application users interact with, so it's important to make it appealing.
- **Performance.** User should not experience low FPS, significant memory and CPU usage, UI glitches, or unnecessary network usage.
- **Unit testing.** The business logic should be well-tested. Furthemore, future improvements should not unintentionally break the existing behavior.
- **Scalable architecture.** Future improvements should not lead to significant changes in the current implementation. Otherwise, these changes may cause bugs.

### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?

Total time spent: ~15 hours.
- Defining functional/non-functional requirements and designing the UX/UI: ~2 hours.
- Development: ~8 hours.
- Testing (including unit tests): ~3 hours.
- README writing: ~2 hour.

### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?

One of the features in the application is the ability to redirect users to external resources. The API provides two types of external resources: websites and YouTube. From a UX perspective, it's decided to use a single button on the recipe view for this purpose. To save time, it's decided to implemente internal business logic to automatically select which resource to open when the button is tapped. In the future, this can be improved to allow users to choose the resource themselves, either by modifying the UX or by displaying menu pop-ups or other specific screens.

### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?

Loading all data at once. It can lead to performance issues, especially if the dataset is very large. So, as an improvement it would be better to implement pagination to manage data more efficiently.

### External Code and Dependencies: Did you use any external code, libraries, or dependencies?

- **Kingfisher.** It's used to load and cache the images.
- **SnapKit.** It's used to speed up the layout process.

### Additional Information: Is there anything else we should know? Feel free to share any insights or constraints you encountered.

**Debug simulation:**
- In the debug configuration, the API request simulates errors and empty states with a 10% probability each. This setup helps debug various scenarios.

**Functional requirements:**
- Display a list of recipes. Each recipe item should display an image, name, cuisine type, and an external resource button if there are any external resources.
- Display an empty state if the list of loaded recipes is empty.
- Display an error state if the request to fetch recipes fails.
- Display a loading state while recipes are being loaded
- Provide the ability to navigate the user to an external resource related to a recipe.
- Provide the ability to filter recipes by a selected cuisine type.
- Provide the ability to refresh recipes.

**Non-functional requirements:**
- Layout content using UIKit and diffable data sources for performance reasons. Utilize the collection view's compositional layout to speed up the layout process.
- Use iOS 14 as the minimum required version to leverage the compositional layout's useful feature (`NSDiffableDataSourceSectionSnapshot`) introduced in this SDK.
- Load images on demand to reduce unnecessary network usage. 
- Cache images on disk to reduce unnecessary network usage.

**Performance optimizations:**
- Chose UIKit over SwiftUI for recipes list displaying.
- Used a diffable data source, which is more efficient for our use cases.
- Moved diffable snapshot calculations to background thread.
- Disabled diff calculations during switching between concrete cuisine types, as it's unnecessary.
- Load images on demand.
- Cache images on disk.
